* **Dataset:** Global Superstore (CSV)

## 🔑 Key Insights Identified
1.  **Category Profitability:** Technology is the most profitable category, whereas Furniture generates high sales but suffers from low profit margins.
2.  **Regional Dominance:** The APAC (Asia Pacific) and EU (Europe) markets are the top revenue contributors globally.
3.  **Seasonality:** Sales consistently spike towards the end of the year (Nov-Dec), likely driven by holiday demand, while starting slow in Q1.
